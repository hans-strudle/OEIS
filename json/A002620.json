Equivalently, floor(n^2/4).","comments":"b(n) = A002620(n+2) = number of multigraphs with loops on 2 nodes with n edges [so g.f. for b(n) is 1/((1-x)^2*(1-x^2))]. Also number of 2-covers of an n-set; also number of 2 X n binary matrices with no zero columns up to row and column permutation. - _Vladeta Jovovic_, Jun 08 2000a(n) is also the maximal number of edges that a triangle-free graph of n vertices can have. For n = 2m, the maximum is achieved by the bipartite graph K(m, m); for n = 2m + 1, the maximum is achieved by the bipartite graph K(m, m + 1). - Avi Peretz (njk(AT)netvision.net.il), Mar 18 2001a(n) is the number of arithmetic progressions of 3 terms and any mean which can be extracted from the set of the first n natural numbers (starting from 1). - _Santi Spadaro_, Jul 13 2001This is also the order dimension of the (strong) Bruhat order on the Coxeter group A_{n-1} (the symmetric group S_n). - Nathan Reading (reading(AT)math.umn.edu), Mar 07 2002Let M_n denote the n X n matrix m(i,j) = 2 if i = j; m(i, j) = 1 if (i+j) is even; m(i, j) = 0 if i + j is odd, then a(n+2) = det M_n. - _Benoit Cloitre_, Jun 19 2002Sums of pairs of neighboring terms are triangular numbers in increasing order. - _Amarnath Murthy_, Aug 19 2002Also, from the starting position in standard chess, minimum number of captures by pawns of the same color to place n of them on the same file (column). Beyond a(6), the board and number of pieces available for capture are assumed to be extended enough to accomplish this task. - _Rick L. Shepherd_, Sep 17 2002For example, a(2) = 1 and one capture can produce \"doubled pawns\", a(3) = 2 and two captures is sufficient to produce tripled pawns, etc. (Of course other, uncounted, non-capturing pawn moves are also necessary from the starting position in order to put three or more pawns on a given file.) - _Rick L. Shepherd_, Sep 17 2002Terms are the geometric mean and arithmetic mean of their neighbors alternately. - _Amarnath Murthy_, Oct 17 2002Maximum product of two integers whose sum is n. - _Matthew Vandermast_, Mar 04 2003a(n+1) gives number of non-symmetric partitions of n into at most 3 parts, with zeros used as padding.

E.g., a(4) = 4 because we have U*DUUU*DDDU*D, UU*DUU*DDU*DD, UU*DDU*DUU*DD and UUU*DU*DU*DDD, where U = (1, 1), D = (1, -1) and * indicates a peak. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Jan 12 2004Number of valid inequalities of the form j + k < n + 1, where j and k are positive integers, j <= k, n >= 0.

Zizka_, Nov 19 2014Also a(n-1) = C(((n+(n mod 2))/2), 2) + C(((n-(n mod 2))/2), 2), so this is the second diagonal of A061857 and A061866, and each even-indexed term is the average of its two neighbors. - _Antti Karttunen_Equals triangle A171608 * ( 1, 2, 3, ...). - _Gary W. Adamson_, Dec 12 2009a(n) gives the number of nonisomorphic faithful representations of the Symmetric group S_3 of dimension n. Any faithful representation of S_3 must contain at least one copy of the 2-dimensional irrep, along with any combination of the two 1-dimensional irreps. - _Andrew Rupinski_, Jan 20 2011a(n+2) counts the number of ways to make change for \"c\" cents, letting n = floor(c/5) to account for the 5-repetitive nature of the task, using only pennies, nickels and dimes (see A187243). - _Adam Sasson_, Mar 07 2011a(n) belongs to the sequence if and only if a(n) = floor(sqrt(a(n))) * ceiling(sqrt(a(n))), that is, a(n) = k^2 or a(n) = k*(k+1), k >= 0. - _Daniel Forgues_, Apr 17 2011a(n) is the sum of the positive integers < n that have the opposite parity as n.Deleting the first 0 from the sequence results in a sequence b = 0, 1, 2, 4, ... such that b(n) is sum of the positive integers <= n that have the same parity as n. The sequence b(n) is the additive counterpart of the double factorial. - _Peter Luschny_, Jul 06 2011Third outer diagonal of Losanitsch's Triangle, A034851. - _Fred Daniel Kline_, Sep 10 2011Written as a(1) = 1, a(n) = a(n-1) + ceiling (a(n-1)) this is to ceiling as A002984 is to floor, and as A033638 is to round. - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Oct 08 2011a(n-2) counts the number of distinct graphs with n vertices and n regions. - _Erik Hasse_, Oct 18 2011Construct the n-th row of Pascal's triangle (A007318) from the preceding row, starting with row 0 = 1. a(n) counts the total number of additions required to compute the triangle in this way up to row n, with the restrictions that copying a term does not count as an addition, and that all additions not required by the symmetry of Pascal's triangle are replaced by copying terms. - _Douglas Latimer_, Mar 05 2012a(n) is the sum of the positive differences of the parts in the partitions of n+1 into exactly 2 parts. - _Wesley Ivan Hurt_, Jan 27 2013a(n) is the maximum number of covering relations possible in an n-element graded poset.
