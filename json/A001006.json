(Given such a Dyck n-path, change each UUD to U, then change each remaining UD to F. This is a bijection to Motzkin n-paths. Example with n=5: U U D U D U U D D D -> U F U D D.) - _David Callan_, Jul 15 2004Number of Dyck (n+1)-paths with no UDU. (Given such a Dyck (n+1)-path, mark each U that is followed by a D and each D that is not followed by a U. Then change each unmarked U whose matching D is marked to an F. Lastly, delete all the marked steps. This is a bijection to Motzkin n-paths. Example with n=6 and marked steps in small type: U U u d D U U u d d d D u d -> U U u d D F F u d d d D u d -> U U D F F D.) - _David Callan_, Jul 15 2004a(n) is the number of strings of length 2n from the following recursively defined set: L contains the empty string and, for any strings a and b in L, we also find (ab) in L. The first few elements of L are e, (), (()), ((())), (()()), (((()))), ((()())), ((())()), (()(())) and so on. This proves that a(n) is less than or equal to C(n), the n-th Catalan number. - Saul Schleimer (saulsch(AT)math.rutgers.edu), Feb 23 2006a(n) = number of Dyck n-paths all of whose valleys have even x-coordinate (when path starts at origin). For example, T(4,2)=3 counts UDUDUUDD, UDUUDDUD, UUDDUDUD. Given such a path, split it into n subpaths of length 2 and transform UU->U, DD->D, UD->F (there will be no DUs for that would entail a valley with odd x-coordinate). This is a bijection to Motzkin n-paths. - _David Callan_, Jun 07 2006Also the number of standard Young tableaux of height <= 3. - _Mike Zabrocki_, Mar 24 2007a(n) is the number of RNA shapes of size 2n+2. RNA Shapes are essentially Dyck words without \"directly nested\" motifs of the form A[[B]]C, for A, B and C Dyck words. The first RNA Shapes are []; [][]; [][][], [[][]]; [][][][], [][[][]], [[][][]], [[][]][]; ... - Yann Ponty (ponty(AT)lri.fr), May 30 2007Equals right and left borders and row sums of triangle A144218 with offset variations. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Sep 14 2008The sequence is self-generated from top row A going to the left starting (1,1) and bottom row = B, the same sequence but starting (0,1) and going to the right. Take dot product of A and B and add the result to n-th term of A to get the (n+1)-th term of A. Example: a(5) = 21 as follows: Take dot product of A = (9, 4, 2, 1, 1) and (0, 1, 1, 2, 4) = (0, + 4 + 2 + 2 + 4) = 12; which is added to 9 = 21. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Oct 27 2008Equals A005773 / A005773 shifted (i.e., (1,2,5,13,35,96,...) / (1,1,2,5,13,35,96,...)). - _Gary W. Adamson_, Dec 21 2008Starting with offset 1 = iterates of M * [1,1,0,0,0,...], where M = a tridiagonal matrix with [0,1,1,1,...] in the main diagonal and [1,1,1,...] in the super and subdiagonals. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Jan 07 2009a(n) is the number of involutions of {1,2,...,n} having genus 0. The genus g(p) of a permutation p of {1,2,...,n} is defined by g(p)=(1/2)[n+1-z(p)-z(cp')], where p' is the inverse permutation of p, c = 234...n1 = (1,2,...,n), and z(q) is the number of cycles of the permutation q. Example: a(4)=9; indeed, p=3412=(13)(24) is the only involution of {1,2,3,4} with genus >0. This follows easily from the fact that a permutation p of {1,2,...,n} has genus 0 if and only if the cycle decomposition of p gives a noncrossing partition of {1,2,...,n} and each cycle of p is increasing (see Lemma 2.1 of the Dulucq-Simion reference). [Also, redundantly, for p=3412=(13)(24) we have cp'=2341*3412=4123=(1432) and so g(p)=(1/2)(4+1-2-1)=1.] - _Emeric Deutsch_, May 29 2010Let w(i,j,n) denote walks in N^2 which satisfy the multivariate recurrencew(i,j,n) = w(i, j + 1, n - 1) + w(i - 1, j, n - 1) + w(i + 1, j - 1, n - 1) with boundary conditions w(0,0,0) = 1 and w(i,j,n) = 0 if i or j or n is < 0. Then a(n) = Sum{i = 0..n,j = 0..n} w(i,j,n) is the number of such walks of length n. - _Peter Luschny_, May 21 2011a(n)/a(n-1) tends to 3.0 as Lim N->inf: (1+2*Cos 2Pi/N) relating to longest odd N regular polygon diagonals, by way of example, N=7: Using the tridiagonal generator [Cf. comment of Jan 07 2009], for polygon N=7, we extract an (N-1)/2 = 3 X 3 matrix, [0,1,0; 1,1,1; 0,1,1] with an e-val of 2.24697...; the longest Heptagon diagonal with edge = 1. As N tends to infinity, the diagonal lengths tend to 3.0, the convergent of the sequence. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Jun 08 2011Number of (n+1)-length permutations avoiding the pattern 132 and the dotted pattern 23\\dot{1}. - _Jean-Luc Baril_, Mar 07 2012Number of n-length words w over alphabet {a,b,c} such that for every prefix z of w we have #(z,a) >= #(z,b) >= #(z,c), where #(z,x) counts the number of letters x in word z.  The a(4) = 9 words are: aaaa, aaab, aaba, abaa, aabb, abab, aabc, abac, abca. - _Alois P. Heinz_, May 26 2012Number of length-n restricted growth strings (RGS) [r(1), r(2), ..., r(n)] such that r(1)=1, r(k)<=k, and r(k)!=r(k-1); for example, the 9 RGS for n=4 are 1010, 1012, 1201, 1210, 1212, 1230, 1231, 1232, 1234. - _Joerg Arndt_, Apr 16 2013Number of length-n restricted growth strings (RGS) [r(1), r(2), ..., r(n)] such that r(1)=0, r(k)<=k and r(k)-r(k-1) != 1; for example, the 9 RGS for n=4 are 0000, 0002, 0003, 0004, 0022, 0024, 0033, 0222, 0224. - _Joerg Arndt_, Apr 17 2013Number of (4231,5276143)-avoiding involutions in S_n. - _Alexander Burstein_, Mar 05 2014a(n) is the number of increasing unary-binary trees with n nodes who have an associated permutation avoids 132. For more information about unary-binary trees with associated permutations, see A245888. - _Manda Riehl_, Aug 07 2014a(n) is the number of involutions on [n] avoiding the single pattern p, where p is any one of the 8 (classical) patterns 1234, 1243, 1432, 2134, 2143, 3214, 3412, 4321. Also, number of (3412,2413)-, (3412,3142)-, (3412,2413,3142)-avoiding involutions on [n] because each of these 3 sets actually coincides with the 3412-avoiding involutions on [n]. This is a complete list of the 8 singles, 2 pairs, and 1 triple of 4-letter classical patterns whose involution avoiders  are counted by the Motzkin numbers.
